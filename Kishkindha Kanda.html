     <h2>Kishkindha Kanda (the book of Kishkindha) is the fourth book of the Valmiki Ramayana, which is one of the two great epics of India (the other being the Mahabharata).
Sugriva lived in Rishyamuka not long before Rama and Lakshmana reached there. The great vanara or monkey lived in exile in the mountain region because he was driven away from Kishkindha by his elder brother Vali and was also robbed of his wife. When Sugriva saw Rama and Lakshmana with arms, he thought that they were sent by his brother Vali to kill him and thus he moved away from the place and sent Hanuman in the guise of a hermit to know the purpose of visit of the two strangers. After hearing everything from Lakshmana, Hanuman thought that the two brothers can also help Sugriva to regain his kingdom and his wife from Vali and thus took them to Sugriva. 
Rama and Lakshmana were guided by Hanuman to the place where Sugriva was present. Rama held conversation with the monkey chief Sugriva regarding the search and rescue of Sita and also the regaining of Sugriva's right to Kishkindha by defeating Vali. Thus, Hanuman prepared fire by rubbing two pieces of wood, and passing sun wise about it, Sugriva and Rama were sworn in as friends, and each promised to aid the other. They gazed at each other intently, and neither had his fill of seeing the other. After that, Sugriva told his story and requested Rama for his aid, and Rama engaged himself to overcome the brother of the monkey-chief, and in return Sugriva undertook to recover Sita from the demon Ravana. Sugriva also told Rama that he had seen Sita being carried away by the demon king Ravana of Lanka, and how she had dropped her veil and jewels, and he presented those things before Rama and Lakshmana. 
After hearing the entire story of Sugriva and his misfortune, Rama fared with Sugriva to the city where Vali ruled, and overcame Vali , and put Sugriva on the throne of Kishkindha. After the establishment of Sugriva to the throne of Kishkindha and after the passing away of the four-month rainy season, Sugriva sent out his marshals to summon the monkey host who came from Himalaya and Vindhya and Kailas, from the east and from the west, from far and near, from caves and forests, in hundreds and thousands and millions, and each host was lead by a veteran leader. A large number of monkeys in the world assembled there, and stood in front of Sugriva with joined hands. Then Sugriva offered them to Lord Rama for his service, and would place them under his command. However, Rama believed it best that Sugriva should issue all commands, since he understood them well, and was well-informed of the matter to be accomplished. 
The large army of monkeys under the leadership of Sugriva was ready for any type of combat. As yet, Rama, Lakshmana or Sugriva knew more about Ravana than his mere name. No one was able to tell where he dwelt or where he kept Sita. Thus, Sugriva dispatched that entire host under leaders to search the four quarters for a month, as far as the uttermost bound of any land where men or demons dwelt, or sun shone. But he trusted the great Hanuman more than any one, since the son of the wind-god had his father's energy and swiftness and vehemence and power of access to any place in earth or sky, and he was politic and brave and keen of wit and well-informed of conduct befitting the place and time. Therefore Rama also bestowed his trust in Hanuman, and gave him his signet-ring to show for a sign to Sita when he should discover her. 
The search for Sita began vigorously and Rama waited for the news of Sita eagerly. After a month the hosts came back from searching the north and west and east, sorry and dejected that they had not found Sita. But the southern host searched all the woods and caves and hidden places, till at last they came to the mighty ocean, the home of Varuna, boundless, resounding, covered with dreadful waves. A month had passed and Sita was not found. Thus, the monkeys sat dejected, gazing over the sea and waiting for their end, for they dared not return to Sugriva. The monkeys got to know from Sampati , the brother of Jatayu, that Ravana lived in Lanka and he took away Sita with him.</h2>
