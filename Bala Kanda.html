      <h2>The Ramayana has seven long sections called kandas. Bala Kanda (or Bala Kandam) is the first book of the Valmiki Ramayana. This Kanda narrates about Prince Rama’s birth, his youthful adventures, and his marriage to the Princess Sita.
Dasharatha was the king of Ayodhya and had three wives – Kausalya (eldest wife. She was the daughter of the King of Kosala Kingdom), Kaikeyi (second wife. Kaikeyī belonged ruling family of the Kekaya clan), Sumitra (third wife. She came from the ancient kingdom of Kashi.) but no children.
The thought of his dynasty ending with him saddened King Dasharatha and he was very eager to have a son who would take care of the throne of Ayodhya.
King Dasharatha visited the royal family’s Guru, Vashistha and narrated his problem. Vasistha comforted King Dashrath by telling him that he would have four sons.
With King Dasharath’s consent, Guru Vashistha summoned Rishi Shringi to perform the Putra-Kam yagna (sacrificial fire for the birth of sons). The gods gave him with a bowl of divine nectar.
As the three queens sat to eat their share of the prasadam, an eagle snatched Sumitra’s share. To console Sumitra, Kaikeyi and Kausalya gave half of their share each to Sumitra. With Kausalya and Kaikeyi each bearing one son i.e. Rama was born to Kausalya, Bharata was born to Kaikeyi, and Sumitra gave	  
birth to Bharata and Shatrughna.When Ram was 16 years old, Rishi Vishvamitra visited to the court of King Dasharatha where the King received him with great honour. Rishi Viswamitra lived in the forest and was performing great sacrifices. However, the rakshas (Rakshas) Mericha and Subahu were disturbing sacrificial rites.
He knew that Rama had taken birth on earth to protect his devotees and so he decided to visit King Dasharatha to ask him for favour. The Rishi asked the king to send his sons to the forest with him. Reluctantly the king agreed.Marriage of Lord Rama with Sita, the daughter of Janaka of Mithila forms a major part of the Bala Kanda.Rama drew the bow from its case and strove to bend it; it yielded easily, and he strung and drew it till at last it snapped in two with the sound of an earthquake or a thunder-clap. The thousands of spectators were terrified and amazed, and all but Vishvamitra, Janaka, Rama, and Lakshman fell to the ground. Then Janaka praised Rama and gave orders for the marriage to be prepared, and sent messengers to the kingdom of Ayodhya in order to invite Raja Dasharatha to wedding of his sons</h2>
