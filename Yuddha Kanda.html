     <h2>On hearing the news of Sita from Hanuman, Rama and Lakshmana set out for the South Seas with the monkey army. Ravana’s repentant brother, Vibhishana joined them on the beach. The monkeys built a bridge over the sea. This bridge is known as Ramsetu. When the bridge was built, Rama entered Lanka with his army.
 Battle between Rama and Ravana
A long battle took place between Rama and Ravana in Lanka. According to the Ramayana story, during the battle between Rama and Ravana, Rama worshipped Bhadrakali (a form of Devi Durga or Adishakti) with 108 blue colored Padma (lotus flowers) in order to destroy Ravana’s power. Ravana was killed in the battle. Rama placed Vibhishana on the throne of Lanka.
 Keeping Drongiri mountain onto his palms, Hanuman flew back to Lanka.
When Rama was battling Ravana, his brother Lakshmana even Rama was seriously wounded. Rama then sent for Sushena who was a great physician and expert in ancient medical science. Sushena ordered Hanuman to fly to the Himalayas and bring him the Mrit Sanjivani plant so that he could revive Lakshmana. Sushena also told Hanuman that the plant grows in the Drongiri range of the Himalayas. Hanuman left immediately but when he arrived in the mountains, he was confused and did not know where the plant was. So he pulled the whole mountain out of the ground and keeping it onto his palms, he flew back to Lanka. Then the healing herb was picked and applied to Lakshmana. At last, Lakshmana was healed and filled with energy.
Rama met Sita. But Rama asked her to prove her purity by the great Agni Pareeksha (fiery test) since she had been living in the demon house for a long time. Sita entered the fire. Agnidev himself appeared and declared the sanctity of Sita to Rama. The episode of Agnipariksha is presented differently in Valmiki Ramayana and Tulsidasa Ramayana. However, the banishment period expired. Rama, Sita and Lakshmana returned to Ayodhya. Rama was crowned there.</h2>
