      <h2>Ayodhya Kanda (the book of Ayodhya) is the second book of the Valmiki Ramayana.The ageing King Dasaratha therefore decided to install him as his successor. 
Manthara made her believe that the inauguration would place her in an inferior position and that Bharata would be banished or killed. Consequently, she asked the king for the two boons he had once offered her: firstly, that Bharata should be installed as yuvraja, and secondly, that Sri Rama be banished to the forest for fourteen years.
The helpless king was shocked at Kaikeyi’s requests but was forced to give in.Bharata returned from his uncle’s home and when he learnt about the tragic events, he railed against his scheming mother and refused to accept the kingdom. He at once set out to meet Sri Rama, determined to bring him back.
Although Bharata tried in various ways to coerce Sri Rama to return to Ayodhya as king, the lord was insistent on keeping his promise. Bharata returned, carrying Sri Rama’s sandals which he placed on the throne. He ruled as Sri Rama’s regent from Nandigrama, a little village away from the city.</h2>
